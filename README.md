## UX

The primary goal of this website is to test a user's memory in an online environment, rather than the common alternatives of physical cards that require you to remember your previous bests or shuffle the cards manually after each turn. This provides a faster alternative that's suitable for all ages

### User Stories

As a user who wants to test my memory, I want:
1. A simple design that allows me to focus on the game
2. A fun animation to keep me engaged whilst playing the game
3. To see the colors of the cards that I have already flipped to keep track of what colors are left
4. A short delay after I flip two non-matching cards so I have time to remember them 
5. A counter to keep track of how many turns I've taken
6. A notification that tells me when I have completed the game and how many turns it took
7. A best tries count so I can aim to beat my record
8. A reset button to reset the game at the end of a round
9. Distinct colours to easily differentiate the cards once flipped

## Gameplay

How to play:
1. The game starts with all 16 cards face-down.
2. Click on any card to flip it over and reveal its color.
3. Click on a second card.
4. If the two cards match, they will remain face-up.
5. If they do not match, they will flip back over after a short delay, and you can try again.
6. The goal is to find all 8 matching pairs in the fewest number of tries.

## Design

The website is comprised of one page featuring the game. It provides a clear space to enable easy gameplay.

### Colours
Shades of pink for the main color palette with black and dark green for accent colors and text

Bright colorful shades for the cards for easy distinction. I made the red shade slightly darker to contrast more from the pink on the unflipped cards

### Fonts

I used google fonts to find a clean and easy to read font and decided on "Quicksand"

### Icons

Fontawesome allowed me to find a suitable favicon for the document title, I chose a chessboard as this provided a similar grid to the game board in the game.

## Wireframes

### Main Page

In order to keep good game functionality, it was important to keep the page layout the same on a mobile as it would be on a larger screen size. In order to do this I kept the same grid layout but made the cards smaller which allowed the grid to fit on a mobile device.

## Deployment

### Repository

1. Intially I created a public repository on my Github account and copied this to my repository on Visual Studio using the following commands
    - git config --global user.name (add username)
    - git config --global user.email (add email)
    - git config --list
2. Throughout my work on the project, I regularly committed my work to github using the following commands
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "Consise message detailing what was changed"
3. After several commits were made, I then pushed my work to Github using:
    - git push

### Hosting

1. On conception of the project and having completed the initial coding work for the project, I went onto my project repository on github to set up for deployment
2. I went into Settings > Pages and ensured that "Deploy from a branch" was selected the main branch was the branch chosen then pressed save and waited for deployment
3. Once deployed I made sure everything was working as observed in my preview browser to ensure files were properly uploaded
